    <h4 class="center thirtysize bold">About Me</h4>
    <h4 class="box1 box2 box3">I was born in Orange, Southern California, and moved to Fountain Valley (which was 10 miles away) when I was 3. I was raised in Orange County my whole life. Both my parents were born in Vietnam, and moved to the U.S. in their teens. I have a younger sister, and also a dog named Wilson. I've been playing tennis pretty much my whole life, and now it's become my career. When I was a kid I played the piano, and now that I'm older I'm itching to go back to relearning how to play music. I enjoy being outside, connecting with nature, going for walks, taking everything in, as much as I can, as often as I can. I love experiencing new things, seeing new sights, it's a thrill. When I'm older I would love to take a year and travel and see everything the world has to offer.</h4>
